# Calendar Agent Vision

## Value Proposition

A. **Persistent context and memory**
B. **Intelligent create/edit/delete** — knows when to look up more info, edit vs. create, etc.
C. **Proactive eventually**
D. **Calendar reasoning** — "when do I have time for this?", "I'm overwhelmed, help me plan"
E. **Clarifying questions**
F. **Feels premium** — something you'd pay for
G. **Beyond session-by-session** — multi-source input (photo + text + PDF in one thread), agent detects what's scheduling vs. context vs. question
H. **Engineering argument** — adding capabilities to the pipeline means new stages or bloated stages with messy inter-stage contracts. Agent with tools scales linearly. Pipeline stages become tools the agent calls.

## Pricing / Tiers — Open Questions

- Option A: pipeline = free, agent = paid. Two systems, clean cost split.
- Option B: agent for everyone, limited free tier (create-only, no memory). One architecture, one UX.
- What's the right upgrade moment? What are the free limits?
